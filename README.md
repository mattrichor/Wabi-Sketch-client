### **_Description_**

'Wabi-sabi' (侘寂) refers to a world view centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection within Japanese traditional aesthetic. Wabi-Sketch aims to be a place where users can take a small moment out of their day to experience the simple enjoyment of sketching, without any other goal in mind. Wabi-sketch will also provide a space to share fun sketches with friends, & build on top of other's sketches. There will be an option similar to a buddha board, where your sketches will fade with time. Additional goals are to have a daily sketch prompt, where every morning users are given an opportunity to sketch something simple in a time allotted. The creation of art doesn't need to be difficult, it just needs to be fun!

### **_Getting Started_**

The landing page prompts a user to either login or register. For a demo, select the 'Guest Login' button. Once logged in, you'll be brought to the home page! Here you can view your friends / requests, notifications, as well as the main attraction: get to sketching. There are 3 brush options (line, brush, and fractal), a responsive color wheel, and an undo button. 

To send a sketch to a friend, simply hover over their name and click the 'send sketch' button. The other user will be notified in realtime, and they can edit on top of the sketch you sent them. 

New to Wabi-sketch and looking for friends? Check out the explore page! Here you can view your requests, and search the database by username to send requests to any user. Once your request has been accepted, you'll be able to send them sketches!

Additionally, every day there is a prompt with 5 colors associated with it. if you'd like to participate in the daily musing, head over that page from the nav menu. You can chat in realtime with anyone else who is participating!
