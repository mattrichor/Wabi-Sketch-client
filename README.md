### **_Description_**

'Wabi-sabi' (侘寂) refers to a world view centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection within Japanese traditional aesthetic. Wabi-Sketch aims to be a place where users can take a small moment out of their day to experience the simple transient enjoyment of sketching, without any other goal in mind. I believe everyone is an artist, regardless of what technical ability they may possess. Wabi-sketch will also provide a space to share fun sketches with friends, & build on top of other's sketches. There will be an option similar to a buddha board, where your sketches will fade with time. Additional goals are to have a daily sketch prompt, where every morning users are given an opportunity to sketch something simple in a time allotted. The creation of art doesn't need to be difficult, it just needs to be fun!
