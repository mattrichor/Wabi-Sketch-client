### **_Description_**

'Wabi-sabi' (侘寂) refers to a world view centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection within Japanese traditional aesthetic. Wabi-Sketch aims to be a place where users can take a small moment out of their day to experience the simple enjoyment of sketching, without any other goal in mind. Wabi-sketch will also provide a space to share fun sketches with friends, & build on top of other's sketches. There will be an option similar to a buddha board, where your sketches will fade with time. Additional goals are to have a daily sketch prompt, where every morning users are given an opportunity to sketch something simple in a time allotted. The creation of art doesn't need to be difficult, it just needs to be fun!

Project will be built with Django interfacing with Postgresql for the backend, and React.JS with modular components for the client.
